Period 1 Report:

I have concluded my research phase of the process and am ready to begin implementation in the upcoming period of time.

In the upcoming two week period I want to establish a simple UI an a user to input a user name and password, and successfully log into their account through database verification.

As well as this, I will create a detailed UML diagram for the remainder of the project to allow my self a strong sense of direction when moving forward and adding the remaining features.

I feel confident about what this application needs and what I want to make sure it contains. I am certain that I have a strong sense of direction with where this project is headed and am excited to begin the implementation phase.
