Report 1:

I have concluded my research and preparatory phase of the process and am ready to begin implementation in the upcoming two weeks. 

In the upcoming two week period I want to establish a simple UI which allows a user to input a user name and password, and create an account. 

Once they create this account, the information will be stored in the database (which I will set up) and the user will be able to input their credentials and successfully log into their account through the app.

As well as this, in this two week period I will create a detailed UML diagram for the project to further give my self a strong sense of direction when moving forward and adding the remaining features.

I feel confident about what this application needs and what I want to make sure it contains, I am excited for this upcoming 2 week period.
